# USA House Price Prediction Using Regression

The data which is used in this project has been taken from the kaggle. The dataset is of USA Housing Dataset which includes 7 columns including target variable "Price". In this task we have to predict the house prices in USA. I have created this notebook to just try handful of ML regression algorithms via; sklearn pipeline.

The project includes basic EDA, Outlier Analysis, Baseline Model Building, Model Comparison, Sklearn-Pipeline to Avoid Data Leakage, Cross Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning Using Randomsized Search CV & Prediction.

The Regression Algorithms which I have tested in this notebook are as follows:

1) Linear Regression

2) Robust Regression

3) TheilSen Regression

4) KNN Regressor

5) Decision Tree Regressor

6) Elastic Net

7) Ridge/Lasso

8) Stochastic Gradient Descent

9) Catboost

10) LightGBM

11) Gradient Boosting Regressor

12) Random Forest Regressor

13) Adaboost Regressor
